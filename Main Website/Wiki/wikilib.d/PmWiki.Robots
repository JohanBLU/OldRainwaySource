text=(:Summary: Setting available to control robots:)%0a%25rfloat%25''This page is under construction.'' %0aFor PmWiki v2.1 (or later) it is supposed to describe "robots" in general, and the settings available to control them.%0a%0a%0a!!Nofollow links%0aThe default PmWiki skin adds "rel=nofollow" to all the [[available actions]] (edit, diff, upload, and print action links at the top and bottom of the page). %0aThis is a convention introduced by Google and it tells the robot crawler not to give any weight to the content accessed by "nofollow" links. '^[[http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2005/01/preventing-comment-spam.html|#]]^'%0aNote that many robots, including Yahoo! Slurp and msnbot, completely ignore the nofollow attributes on links.%0a%0aThe anti-spam convention that first introduced "nofollow" doesn't say anything about robots not following the links,only that links with rel="nofollow" shouldn't given any weight in search results.%0a%0ayou can also add rel=nofollow in a [[wiki style(s), viz [=%25rel=nofollow%25=], to specify %0a%0a%0a!! The file @@robots.txt@@%0a%0aHere's one example of the contents of a ''robots.txt'', that primarily would tell robots to ignore links containing '@@action@@'.:%0a%0a-> [@%0aUser-agent: *%0aDisallow: /pmwiki.php/Main/AllRecentChanges%0aDisallow: /pmwiki.php/%0aDisallow: */search%0aDisallow: SearchWiki%0aDisallow: *RecentChanges%0aDisallow: RecentChanges%0aDisallow: *action=%0aDisallow: action=%0aUser-Agent: W3C-checklink%0aDisallow:%0a@]%0a%0a!!
