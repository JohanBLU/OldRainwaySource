text=(:Summary:Technical notes on the UpdatePage() function.  It is updated as of 2.2.0 Beta65.:)''{$:Summary}''%0a(:Audience:Developers:)%0a%0a! @@UpdatePage($editPageName, $old (page object), $new (page object));@@%0a%0a[@UpdatePage()@] is a code hook allowing cookbook recipes to mimic the behavior of editing wiki pages via the browser. It accepts a page object (array) of page data then performs all the usual PmWiki housekeeping tasks that would be performed on text submitted by the edit form in a browser window i.e. it preserves history/diff information, updates page revision numbers, updates RecentChanges pages, sends email notifications, etc.%0a* "Page object" refers to an array pulled from [@RetrieveAuthPage($somePageNameYouAreEditing, $level, $authprompt=true, $since=0);@] (preferred), or [@ReadPage($pagename); @] (disregards page security). Note that $new['text'] should contain all page data for the new version of the page. See [[PmWiki/PageFileFormat]] for more information on the type of information you may be able to access in the array.%0a* If a page doesn't exist, UpdatePage() will attempt to create it.%0a* If you retrieved $old using RetrieveAuthPage($editPageName,$auth,$prompt,READPAGE_CURRENT) and set $new=$old, then UpdatePage or WritePage will also erase all historical data (because READPAGE_CURRENT only reads and returns the current version of the page without any history; the same happens with [@ReadPage($pagename, READPAGE_CURRENT)@]).%0a%0a!! Caution%0a%0aIf used incorrectly, [@UpdatePage()@] can not only blank pages, but can wipe entire histories of pages - PmWiki cannot recover an old version if you accidentally drop the page history when you read or save a page.%0a%0a!! Calling [@UpdatePage()@]%0a%0a@@UpdatePage()@@ cannot be called directly from config.php or an [@include()@]d recipe because there are necessary initializations which occur later in pmwiki.php.  To use @@UpdatePage()@@, do it within a [[PmWiki:CustomMarkup | custom markup]], a [[Cookbook:MarkupExpressionSamples | custom markup expression]], or a [[PmWiki:CustomActions | custom action]].%0a%0a[@UpdatePage()@] does very little itself other than traverse [@$EditFunctions@] and call each function contained there.  ([@$EditFunctions@] can be overridden by the 4th argument [@$fnlist@], but this is fairly rare).%0a%0aThe global [@$IsPagePosted@] is set to FALSE at the start of UpdatePage() and then returned at the end of this function.  Any of the intervening functions can set it to TRUE (indicating successful posting/saving) but normally this is the job of the function PostPage().%0a%0aHere is the definition of $EditFunctions from pmwiki.php:%0a%0a[@$EditFunctions = array('EditTemplate', 'RestorePage', 'ReplaceOnSave',%0a  'SaveAttributes', 'PostPage', 'PostRecentChanges', 'AutoCreateTargets',%0a  'PreviewPage');@]%0a%0a!! Recipes can change how edits work%0a%0aCookbook Authors can add their own functions to [@$EditFunctions@] as needed.%0a%0aAs an example, suppose you need to know the [@$pagename@] of the page being edited for some reason (Maybe you've added to [@$ROSPatterns@]):%0a%0a[@%0a  global $EditFunctions; # if inside a function%0a  array_unshift($EditFunctions, "GetEditPagename");%0a  // ...%0a  function GetEditPagename($pagename, $p, $n) {%0a    global $EditPagename;%0a    $EditPagename=$pagename;%0a  }%0a@]%0a%0aOr if you need to do processing after a page has been saved:%0a%0a[@%0a  $EditFunctions[]= "MyPostEditProcessing"; // Add to end of $EditFunctions%0a  function MyPostEditProcessing($pagename, $p, $n) {%0a    // mirror page to another site, send an email, update page lists somewhere, etc%0a    // Might check global $IsPagePosted%0a  }%0a@]%0a%0a! Default [@$EditFunctions@]%0a!!EditTemplate%0aThis function allows pre-populating new pages with the contents of a template page.  If the $new['text'] contains anything then this function does nothing.%0a%0aThe pagename of the template can be passed in the [@$_REQUEST['template']@].%0a%0aOtherwise the [@$EditTemplatesFmt@] array is traversed and each page read until obtaining some text which then becomes the text of the $new['text'].%0a%0a!!RestorePage%0a%0aOn a normal save of a page this function does nothing.%0a%0aThe value for [@$Restore@] can be passed by argument to the function, but it will not in the context of UpdatePage().  The value will be obtained instead from [@$_REQUEST['restore']@].  If this value is not set then this function will do nothing.  If this value is set to a timestamp then the page history will be traversed and the various diff's in page history will be reverse applied until the requested timestamp.%0a%0a!!ReplaceOnSave%0a%0aThere are 2 arrays: [@$ROEPatterns@] and [@$ROSPatterns@].  In each array the key to the hash is the search-pattern and the value to the hash is the replace-pattern.  [@$ROEPatterns@] is replaced on each edit, [@$ROSPatterns@] only if [@$EnablePost@] is set.  %0a%0a!!SaveAttributes%0a%0aSeveral different attributes are calculated to become one of the keys of the $new[] page array.  (Each of these will then become their own line in the pagefile.)  Targets are calculated as a space-separated list of pages which are linked to from this page.  Properties held in the global [@$SaveProperties@] are copied from the $page[] (old page) array.%0a%0a* '''Note:''' [@SaveAttributes@] runs [@MarkupToHTML()@] on the page text.  This sets page variables, but may have side effects (if you are keeping a count of your markup, writing to files every time a page is viewed, etc).%0a%0a!!PostPage%0a%0a[@$IsPagePosted@] is set to false.%0a%0aIf [@$EnablePost@] is true then these steps occur:%0a*Attributes such as 'charset' ([@$Charset@]), 'author' ([@$Author@]), 'author:%3ctimestamp>' ([@$Author@]), and 'host:%3ctimestamp>' ([@$_SERVER['REMOTE_ADDR']@]) are set.%0a*A diff is done between the previous text and the current text and the result stored as a '%3ctimestamp>' key.%0a*If the text matches the global [@$DeleteKeyPattern@] then the page is deleted.%0a*WritePage() is called %0a*[@$IsPagePosted@] is set to true.%0a%0a!!PostRecentChanges%0a%0aIf [@$IsPagePosted@] is NOT true then do nothing.%0a%0aThe global array [@$RecentChangesFmt[]@] is traversed with the KEY to the hashed array being the pagename where the changes should be written to and the VALUE of the hashed array being the text to be written to the end of that page.%0a%0aIf the number of lines in the recentchanges page exceeds the global [@$RCLinesMax@] then the page is chopped appropriately.%0a%0aThe recentchanges page is written via WritePage().%0a%0a!!AutoCreateTargets%0a%0aIf link targets within the page match some global and they do not exist then they will be automatically created.  See also [[(Cookbook:)AutoCreatePages]].%0a%0a!!PreviewPage%0a%0aThis function does nothing if you're not doing a preview.%0a%0a! Other [@$EditFunctions@]%0a%0aThere are other [@$EditFunctions@] that come with PmWiki but that are not part of the basic functionality:%0a%0a!! author.php%0a%0a[@ array_unshift($EditFunctions,'RequireAuthor'); @] // Makes sure an author is specified before allowing page to be edited%0a%0a!! blocklist.php%0a%0a[@ array_unshift($EditFunctions, 'CheckBlocklist'); @]%0a%0a!! draft.php%0a%0a[@ array_unshift($EditFunctions, 'EditDraft'); @] // Check if saving to the draft file and if so, change names and Redirect to the draft page to continue edit.%0a%0a* '''Note''': This may change $pagename unexpectedly%0a%0a!! notify.php%0a%0a[@ $EditFunctions[] = 'PostNotify'; @] // Add 'PostNotify' to send an email after edit successfully done%0a%0a!! pagelist.php%0a%0a[@ $EditFunctions[] = 'PostPageIndex'; @] // handle [=(:pagelist:)=] functionality after a page is updated%0a%0a!! simuledit.php%0a%0a[@ array_unshift($EditFunctions,'MergeSimulEdits'); @] // If more than one edit happened since page load, merge the changes before saving%0a%0a!! transition.php%0a%0aHandles transitions between PmWiki versions.  Used for GUI Edit buttons.%0a%0a!! urlapprove.php%0a%0a[@ array_splice($EditFunctions, array_search('PostPage', $EditFunctions), 0, 'BlockUnapprovedPosts'); @]%0a%0aPuts the [@BlockUnapprovedPosts()@] function right before [@PostPage()@]%0a%0a%0a----%0a%0a!Notes%0a%0a!!!!!Can I call @@UpdatePage()@@ directly from @@config.php@@?%0aNo. As stated on the [[PmWiki/Functions | PmWiki/Functions]]:  @@UpdatePage()@@ cannot be called directly from @@config.php@@ because there are necessary initializations which occur later in @@pmwiki.php@@. It is not enough to just load @@stdconfig.php@@. If you want to use @@UpdatePage()@@ you will need to do it within a [[PmWiki/CustomMarkup | custom markup]], a [[Cookbook/MarkupExpressionSamples | custom markup expression]], or a [[PmWiki/CustomActions | custom action]].%0a%0a----%0a%0aCategory: [[!PmWiki Internals]] [[!PmWiki Developer]]
