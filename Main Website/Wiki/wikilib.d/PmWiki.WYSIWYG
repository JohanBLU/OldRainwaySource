text=(:Summary:Notes about WYSIWYG support in PmWiki:)%0a%0a'''Q: Does PmWiki support any sort of WYSIWYG editing?'''\\\%0a'''Q: Has anyone integrated the FCKEditor with PmWiki?'''%0a%0a'''17-May-2011:''' A [[Cookbook.WYSIWYG Fund Drive | fund drive]] has been setup to cover the costs of creating a WYSIWYG capability for PmWiki. %0a%0a'''July 2017:''' See/try the addon [[Cookbook/Worse|+]]: {Cookbook.Worse$:Summary}%0a%0a''Pm's response:''%0a%0aThe short answer to these questions is that WYSIWYG editing greatly %0areduces the types of customizations that can be performed, and%0arestricts the browsers that can perform editing.  As such, it tends%0ato go strongly against [[PmWikiPhilosophy]] #5 ("Be easy to install,%0aconfigure, and maintain.").%0a%0aThe major problem is that browsers are limited in terms of the%0aamount of WYSIWYG editing that can be provided.  For example,%0amost in-browser editors such as FCKEditor are ''inherently limited''%0ato handling only those markups that they have been pre-programmed %0ato perform.  Furthermore, such editors perform their changes directly%0ato the HTML code, and not the markup that was used to produce the%0aHTML. In other words, in-browser WYSIWYG editors currently use%0aHTML as their underlying storage format.%0a%0aUnfortunately, this means that people with browsers that cannot%0ahandle the JavaScript would be able to edit the pages only by viewing%0aand editing the HTML directly.  It also means that it's not possible%0a(or at least prohibitively difficult) to support markups that don't%0ahave a direct analogue in HTML.%0a%0aOne approach that has been tried (with little success) is to%0aallow the browser to do direct WYSIWYG editing of the HTML, %0aand then attempt to convert the HTML back to wiki markup for %0astorage and editing by other non-capable browsers.  Unfortunately, %0athis can work only for a limited set of markups, and becomes%0aa nightmare if we want to allow wiki administrators to develop%0acustom markups.  (In other words, say goodbye to many cookbook%0arecipes.)%0a%0aIn theory one could write a rendering engine in Javascript%0athat would on-the-fly convert wiki markup into HTML for%0aWYSIWYG display during editing, but I don't know anyone who%0ahas seriously tried this.  Again, it can potentially work if %0athe complete set of available markups is known and fixed, but %0aonce the possibility of custom markup extensions is introduced%0ainto the system, the complexity becomes huge.%0a%0aSince local customization of markup is one of PmWiki's %0amajor strengths, that pretty much closes the door on WYSIWYG%0aediting until/unless we either decide to disallow custom markups,%0aor browser technologies improve to make it easier to have %0aextensible WYSIWYG editing in the browser.  %0a%0aAJAX shows some promise, but I think that WYSIWYG is still a bit%0abeyond its reach unless a site has a lot of bandwidth available%0ato handle rendering requests.  I'm very intrigued by what something%0alike Writely may be able to do, but I think it's limited in its%0acustomization potential.  (However, it's also not a good idea to %0aunderestimate Google's capabilities here).%0a%0aSince PmWiki's inception, I've basically taken the position that%0athe benefits of WYSIWYG editing, which could be considerable, %0aaren't worth the loss of flexibility and capability (such as custom%0amarkup and other items) that would be required to implement it.%0a%0aAnd I think that the fact that other web-editing frameworks%0acontinue to use symbolic markup over WYSIWYG editing is a%0agood indication of just how difficult the task really is.%0a%0aOTOH, if anyone wants to pay me a lot of money to tackle%0athe problem, I could see what I could come up with.  --[[~Pm]]%0a%0a%0a----%0a"Be easy to install,%0aconfigure, and maintain." %0ahtml is easy , wiki syntax isn't%0a%0aWhile it's a prevailing attitude of some, it's really not true.%0aHTML is a huge language space, with tons of inconsistencies%0adeveloped over time by many people who meant well, but were%0amore interested in their own goals instead of establishing%0asomething "sane".%0a%0a----%0aSee also [[http://pmichaud.com/pipermail/pmwiki-users/2003-August/001084.html | Pm's thoughts about markup selection]]%0a%0a----%0a%0a* See ''and vote for'' [[PITS.00421]]%0a* See [[Category.Wysiwyg]] and [[Category.Wikiwyg]]%0a* For example see%0a** http://trac.xinha.org/%0a** [[http://www.dokuwiki.org/plugins?plugintag=wysiwyg#repotable | DokuWiki WYSIWYG plugins]]%0a** http://www.aloha-editor.org/%0a** [[http://www.solmetra.com/en/disp.php/en_products/en_spaw/en_spaw_about |SPAW Editor ]]%0a** http://wikiwig.sourceforge.net/%0a** http://unverse.net/Whizzywig-web-based-rich-text-editor%0a** http://whizzywing.com/ ([[https://github.com/unverse/Whizzywing/downloads|github]])%0a** http://prosemirror.net/%0a** http://editme.com/%0a** [[http://wiki.wordpress.org/WYSIWYG Plugin]]%0a** [[http://wiki.zoho.com/]]%0a** [[http://geniisoft.com/showcase.nsf/WebEditors |Big list of WYSIWYG rich text web editors]]%0a** [[http://info.webtoolhub.com/kb-a49-12-free-online-rich-text-editors-rte.aspx|12 Free Online Rich Text Editors (RTE)]] another list%0a** [[http://ace.ajax.org/ | ACE]] (formerly Bespin and Skywriter), [[(http://www.cdolivet.com/index.php?page=)editArea]] and [[http://codemirror.net/ |CodeMirror]] have the potential to highlight wiki code%0a** [[http://code.google.com/p/ittyeditor/ | Itty Editor]] seems to do WYSIWYG in HTML but then has automatic 2-way conversion to/from markdown%0a** [[https://github.com/cben/CodeMirror-MathJax/|A formula editor]] which flips to/from TEX markdown when the cursor is on the formula%0a* [[http://davidgerard.co.uk/notes/2011/01/04/|What you see is for the win]] - an article claiming that the addition of a visual rich text editor in the MediaWiki software got '''eight times''' the participation.%0a* [[http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Extension:InlineEditor|InlineEditor]] will allow editing of sentences, sections or templates in a Wikipedia page.%0a* [[https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/wiki/File:Parser_and_Editor_-_Haifa_2011.pdf | Editing 2.0 - MediaWiki's upcoming visual editor and the future of templates]] PDF presentation from a MediaWiki developer.
