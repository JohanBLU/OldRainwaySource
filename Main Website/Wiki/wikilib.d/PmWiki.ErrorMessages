text=(:Summary:Help for specific PmWiki error messages:)%0aThis page provides help for specific error messages that sites may encounter when using PmWiki.  If this page doesn't answer your question, try looking at [[Troubleshooting]] and [[FAQ | frequently asked questions]].  If these still don't have the answer you're looking for, try the pmwiki-users [[mailing list(s)]] or ask a question on the [[Questions]] page.%0a%0a----%0a%0a!! Deprecated: preg_replace(): The /e modifier is deprecated%0aSee [[Troubleshooting]].%0a%0a[[#permissions]]%0a!! File permissions%0aMany issues are caused by incorrect [[File Permissions]].%0a%0a[[#flock]]%0a!! Cannot acquire lockfile%0a%0aSomething (or someone) has changed the permissions on the ''wiki.d/.flock'' file or the ''wiki.d/'' directory such that the webserver is no longer able to write the lockfile.  The normal solution is to simply delete the ''.flock'' file from the ''wiki.d/'' directory -- PmWiki will then create a new one.  Also be sure to check the permissions on the ''wiki.d/'' directory itself. %25blue%25 What should the permissions be?%25%25%0aAFAIK, read and write permission for your webserver account (e.g. www:www or apache:apache, 0750)\\%0a%0aSee also [[File Permissions]].%0a%0aNote that on many systems ''.flock'' is a hidden file, so it may still be there even if you cannot view it.  Try deleting it anyway even if you don't see it in the ''wiki.d/'' directory.%0a%0aOther possibilities :%0a%0a*You may have recently moved the wiki and you were previously using EnableIMSCaching.  Disable EnableIMSCaching in your local/config.php file and that could fix the problem [[~RussFink]] (this information should be subject to review).%0a%0a*The wiki.d ownership may have been moved out of reach of the webserver.  E.g. running Apache2 server as user ''www-data'' and deactivating its suphp module would disallow it to write the .flock file under the users permissions.  In such a case, one should change the directory permissions for wiki.d to that of the user under which the web server runs. (this information subject to review)%0a%0a*The issue may be caused by copying files which changed the owner of wiki.d directory.  In such a case one could fix this error by running "chown -R wwwrun ../wiki/wiki.d/".%0a%0a*One more possible cause could be safe mode. Check your logfiles for errors like ''SAFE MODE Restriction in effect.  The script whose uid is 1001 is not allowed to access /www/wiki/wiki.d owned by uid 52 ...''  In this case you either have to turn off safe mode, or change the user/group to the user/group PHP is using (for hosting companies this usually is the user you use to log in) and set permissions to 0777 (that is, write for everyone) or turn off safe mode.%0a%0a*SELinux may be preventing write access (check SELinux logs with the sealert command).  Ensure that SELinux configuration is correct or that SELinux is disabled.  One can temporarily enable the write access by executing "chcon -R -t httpd_sys_rw_content_t 'wiki.d'".%0a%0a*Finally, this error may be due to problems at a broader level on the system.  Symptoms of such an issue would be the inability to create/delete files on the system as well as the ''.flock'' file.%0a%0a[[#htmlheader]]%0a!! Skin template missing %3c!--HTMLHeader-->/%3c!--HTMLFooter-->%0a%0a[[Skin templates]] are now required to contain %3c!--HTMLHeader--> and %3c!--HTMLFooter--> directives.  Some skins developed under older versions of PmWiki failed to include these required directives, thus causing some PmWiki features and recipes to work improperly.%0a%0aTo work around this issue, do any of the following:%0a# Set [@$EnableSkinDiag=0;@] in a local customization file.%0a# If you downloaded the skin from the [[Skins/Skins]] collection, check to see if there's an updated version of the skin that includes the required directives.  %0a# Modify the skin's ''.tmpl'' file to include %3c!--HTMLHeader--> and %3c!--HTMLFooter-->.%0a# If the skin explicitly doesn't want the header/footer information, use %3c!--NoHTMLHeader--> and/or %3c!--NoHTMLFooter--> in the template.%0a%0a%0a[[#skin]]%0a!! Unable to load ''skin'' template%0a%0aPmWiki was able to find a requested [[skin(s)]], but couldn't find an appropriate ''.tmpl'' file to use as a template.  If you have a custom skin, make sure there is exactly one ''.tmpl'' file in the skin's directory.  (See [[skins]] and [[skin templates]].)  If you downloaded a skin from the [[Skins/Skins]] collection, make sure the skin was installed correctly, or contact the skin's author for more assistance.%0a%0a[[#editform]]%0a!! Unable to retrieve edit form Site.EditForm%0a%0aPmWiki was unable to find or load the Site.EditForm page containing the form used to edit pages.  Often this occurs when the ''wikilib.d/'' folder isn't completely copied to the webserver, or when a read password has been placed on Site.EditForm or the Site group.  Double-check that all of the distribution files are correctly copied on the webserver, and that authors have read permission to the Site.EditForm page.%0a%0a[[#readonly]]%0a!! Cannot modify site -- $EnableReadOnly is set%0a%0aPmWiki is attempting to do something that requires modifying pages or files on the filesystem, and the administrator has set the $EnableReadOnly configuration variable.%0a%0a[[#ldapfn]]%0a!! LDAP authentication requires PHP ldap functions%0a%0aPmWiki is attempting to obtain information from an LDAP server (e.g., via ''authuser.php'' and [[AuthUser]]), but the PHP software doesn't appear to have the ldap_* functions available.  PHP may have been built without support for LDAP (see http://www.php.net/ldap ).%0a%0aUbuntu users: install php5-ldap and restart apache. -[[~drdaan]] December 31, 2009, at 02:22 AM%0a%0a!!
