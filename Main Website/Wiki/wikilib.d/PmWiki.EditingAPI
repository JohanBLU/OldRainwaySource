See further down for more details.%0a%0a(:tableend:)%0a%0aSummarizing the requirements to post an update to a page.%0a%0aWriting a page to the wiki via the wiki engine, i.e. via @@pmwiki.php@@ is%0adone via an @@HTTP POST@@ request. At a minimum, the following fields are%0arequired:%0a%0a* @@n=%3cGroup>.%3cPageName>@@%0a* @@text=%3ctext to be posted>@@%0a* @@action=edit@@%0a* @@post=1@@%0a%0aThe two fields @@action=edit@@ and @@post=1@@ together signals that the%0arequest is to write the content of the field @@text@@ to the the destination%0apage, i.e. as specified by the field @@n@@.%0a%0aAdditional fields such as @@author=%3cauthor>@@ and @@diffclass=minor@@ can be%0agiven, see the table of fields for an explanation.%0a%0aIf the page is password protected, the browser must either have been%0apreviously authenticated (via a PHP session cookie) or otherwise send the%0aappropriate credentials to allow edit access to the page.  Normally the%0acredentials are given by the 'authpw' and 'authid' fields:%0a%0a* @@authid=%3cuser-name>@@%0a* @@authpw=%3cpassword>@@%0a%0aSimultaneous edits are handled by the field '@@basetime@@'.  When a browser%0arequests an edit form using @@?action=edit@@, PmWiki includes a hidden field%0a'@@basetime@@' in the edit form that holds the time the form was sent.%0a%0aWhen the form is submitted, if the last modification time of the page is%0agreater than the basetime in the form, we know that the page changed somehow%0aafter the author requested the edit form.  (The basetime also tells PmWiki%0awhich version of the page was "current" when the edit form was requested, so%0ait can figure out how to merge the changes together.)%0a%0aIf a page is changed after a form's basetime, then instead of saving the%0apage PmWiki sends back a new edit form with any merged changes and a note to%0athe author to review the page for conflicts and submit again.%0a%0a-> I think this "note" should be accompanied with something that's well%0a   specified, so as to make it easier for an external script to handle%0a   this situation. /Christian%0a%0aIf a client sends a post request that doesn't include a '@@basetime@@'%0afield, then no simultaneous edit checking is performed, and the contents of%0athe field '@@text@@' replace any existing content.%0a%0aA successful request to save a page generally results in a 302 HTTP%0aresponse, telling the browser to view the (newly saved) page.  If a request%0ato save a page fails, generally PmWiki returns a new edit form along with%0amessages indicating why the page could not be saved.%0a%0a-> I think some formal method is needed to report that a save has been%0a   blocked.  The reason for the block might be a requirement for an author%0a   name, or that blocklist don't like it. There should be an API to detect%0a   this in any case. /Christian%0a%0a%0aChristian's questions:%0a* Can authpw/authid be used to satisfy Apaches Basic Authenticiation as well?%0a%0a!!
